        <p>I studied physics at Penn State and the University of Maryland where I searched for neutrinos with the
            <a href="https://icecube.wisc.edu/">IceCube</a> detector. It was in graduate school that I got the
            opportunity to help build the detector on location
            at the South Pole.

        <p>After earning a PhD, I worked at a
            <a href="http://usersystems.com/">small consultancy</a> focused on the design and operation of Synthetic
            Aperture Radar (SAR) systems.

        <p>At a company called Endgame, I created
            <a

            a machine learning model that recognizes malicious programs. I also released an open source dataset called
            <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-ember-open-source-classifier-and-dataset">EMBER</a> meant
            to spur research in the area. I maintained and extended those two projects through an acquisition by
            <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic</a>.
