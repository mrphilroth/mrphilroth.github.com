<h1>Introducing NBA Rotations</h1>
<ul class="posts"><li><span>12 Apr 2016</span></li></ul>

<p> Once again, I was spurred to throw together a data visualization while
listening to a Bill Simmons podcast. This time, it was a Friday Rollin’ episode
and Bill and Joe House were discussing substitution patterns that NBA coaches
were using this year. They debated bringing the starters out all at the same
time versus slowly rotating in the second unit. They debated how to get your
stars the most rest while still maximizing their playing time. And they
mentioned how Steph Curry was getting lots of opportunities to rest in 4th
quarters this year thanks to big leads.
</p>

<p> My mind was wandering over all the possibilities and wondering what all the
different coaches in the league were actually doing. So I downloaded the data
and I took a look. The result is <a
href="http://nbarotations.info">nbarotations.info</a>. Go ahead over there and
read the <a href="http://nbarotations.info/explanation">explanation</a> to get a
feel for how to use it. Here's a screenshot showing the current average
rotations for the <a href="http://nbarotations.info/team/GSW2016">Golden State
Warriors this year</a>:</p>

<p> There’s all kinds of things you can learn by exploring the data on the site.
For example, <a href="http://nbarotations.info/player/curryst01">most</a> <a
href="http://nbarotations.info/player/jamesle01">stars</a> will get rest at the
beginning of the second and fourth quarters. Some start just before the end of
the first and others play to the end. <a
href="http://nbarotations.info/player/nowitdi01">Some older</a> <a
href="http://nbarotations.info/player/horfoal01">players</a> sit for a short
period in the middle of every quarter. <a
href="http://nbarotations.info/player/duranke01">Kevin Durant</a> actually
switched to this pattern in February of this year. </p>

<p> Other patterns show up as well. <a
href="http://nbarotations.info/team/MEM2016">Injury riddled teams</a> will have
many players listed on their season average page. The Spurs experimented with
their rotations throughout the <a
href="http://nbarotations.info/team/SAS2014">season of their most recent
championship</a>, but were much more consistent <a
href="http://nbarotations.info/team/SAS2016">this year</a>. </p>

<p> I’m sure there are many more things to discover. Click around and
explore.
