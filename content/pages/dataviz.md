I put together [NBA Rotations](http://nbarotations.info/) in order to explore how NBA coahes differ in their substitution patterns. You can quickly get a sketch of a player's entire career through the years or compare two different teams in a single season. I had this page automatically updating for the 2017-18 season.

[This site](http://mlbpayrolls.info/) was my first attempt to use [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to show anything at all. It got a lot of attention from places like [Fangraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/link-visualizing-the-changes-in-mlb-payrolls/) and [Deadspin](https://deadspin.com/this-interactive-graphic-on-mlb-payrolls-is-amazing-1184880875). The last update was in 2016. Perhaps at some point I'll redesign the graphic and set this page up for automatic updates.

I quickly copied the MLB visualization over to the <a href="../nbapayrolls/">NBA</a>. This has not been updated since 2015.

The Buccaneers reached out after seeing the MLB Payrolls graphic. As a freelancer, I was able to put together four data visualizations for them under a new "Data Crunch" series they were starting. This was especially fun to do.

I created some cool plots for old blog posts I put together. The Asiana Flight 214 plots were picked up by [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/asiana-flight-214-speed-chart-2013-7).
