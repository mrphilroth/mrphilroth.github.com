[EMBER: An Open Dataset for Training Static PE Malware
Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04637)<br>
[Learning to Evade Static PE Machine Learning Malware Models
via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08917)<br>

While at Endgame, I've mostly built and deployed production machine learning systems. But I've also done some research and written some papers.

IGARSS Paper: [Ionospheric Stripes in PALSAR data](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6351218&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6351218)<br>
IGARSS Paper: [Simulating SAR through the Ionosphere](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5653180&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5653180)<br>

I worked on SAR systems for a couple years at a very small consultancy. I found reasons for striping that occurred in SAR imagery collected through the ionosphere. 

ApJ Paper: [IceCube Search for Muon Neutrinos from GRBs](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/710/1/346/meta)<br>
PhD Thesis: [IceCube Search for Muon Neutrinos from GRBs](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/9578)<br>

While getting my PhD in physics, I used the IceCube neutrino detector at the South Pole to search for muon neutrinos coming from giant explosions called gamma-ray bursts. I didn't find any. But I did discover an affinity for building machine learning models.
